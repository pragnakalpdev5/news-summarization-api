# Intelligent News Summarization and Analysis API

This API fetches news articles from NewsAPI, processes them using OpenAI's `gpt-40-mini` model, and provides intelligent summaries, sentiment analysis, and topic classification. Built with FastAPI, it also supports easy endpoint access for querying processed results.

## Features
- Fetches and processes news articles based on user search queries.
- Summarizes articles, provides sentiment analysis, and identifies key topics.
- Built with FastAPI for scalable and efficient API services.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/news-summarization-api.git
cd news-summarization-api
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies. Here are the commands to create and activate it:
- For Windows
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
- For macOS/Linux
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project. This file will store sensitive environment variables, such as API keys, and should not be committed to version control.

Your .env file should look like this:
```
plaintext
NEWS_API_KEY=your_news_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Note: Ensure that the .env file is located in the root directory of the project, at the same level as the main application file. This will allow the application to load environment variables correctly.

### 5. Run the API
Now that the environment is configured, start the FastAPI server:
```
bash

fastapi run Fast_API_news.py
```

The API will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

### 6. Testing the API
You can test the /search endpoint by opening your browser and navigating to:
```
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:8000/search?query=technology&page_size=5
```

Or, you can access the interactive API documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

### Example Response
When you make a GET request to the /search endpoint with a query like technology, you can expect a response similar to this:

```
